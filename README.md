Collection of some selected ML/DL assignments I did once and have been using as a pipeline for work in related projects ever since.

Some of them are quite difficult -- like realizing neural network solely by using numpy, or writing my own architecture for a network similar to U-Net.

Also I need to add the pipeline file with info I have been collecting...
